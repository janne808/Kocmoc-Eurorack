\section{Theory of operation} \label{theoryofoperation}

The filter circuit is based on a classic 12dB/oct state variable filter circuit made popular by \cite{chamberlin}. The voltage control is implemented by voltage controlled amplifiers using the SSM2164 chip (or equivalent modern clone).\newline


The two voltage controlled inverting integrators responsible for the filter operation follow the SSI2164 application note example from \cite{allaert}.\newline

\subsection{State variable filter block diagram}

The classic voltage controlled SVF circuit is implemented with the following block diagram

\begin{figure}[H]\centering

      -- (hpsum.south)

      node[](bpout){} to[short, -o] (bpout -| lpout)
      node[above](bp){$bp$}
      % hp output
      (hpsum.east) ++(1,0) to[short, *-] ++(0,-6)

      node[above](hp){$hp$};
\end{circuitikz}

which follows the ordinary differential equation (ODE)

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
x_{1}'(t) &= \alpha \space (input(t) - \zeta \space x_{1}(t) - x_{2}(t)) \\
x_{2}'(t) &= \alpha \space x_{1}(t) \\
\end{split}
\end{align}

where $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the first and second integrator variables respectively, $\zeta$ is the damping factor and $\alpha$ is the integration rate.\newline

\subsection{Fixed interval limiting for integrator}

For a practical synthesizer filter, the integration needs to be limited to a fixed interval by some method. Otherwise the process will result in voltages that get stuck at rail voltages and other instabilities.\newline

In this filter the limiter is implemented in the first integrator with a diode soft clipper circuit in parallel with the feedback integration capacitor. This results in added even harmonics and stable operation even with extreme input drive and resonance settings.\newline

The following circuit implements the inverting soft clipping integrator

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\begin{circuitikz}[american, scale=0.65]
\draw (0,0) node[above](vin){$V_{in}$} to[/tikz/circuitikz/bipoles/length=1cm, R=$R$, o-] ++(4,0)
      -- ++(1,0)
      node[op amp, anchor=-](op1){}
      % to ground
      (op1.+) -- ++(0,-2) node[ground]{}
      % to output
      (op1.out) to[short, -o] ++(3,0)
      node[above](vout){$V_{out}$}
      % capacitor feedback
      (op1.out) ++(1,0) to[short, *-] ++(0,3)
      coordinate(capright)
      to[/tikz/circuitikz/bipoles/length=1cm, C=$C$] ++(-6,0)
      coordinate(capleft)
      to[short, -*] (capleft |- op1.-)
      % diode1 feedback
      (capleft) to[short, *-] ++(0,2)
      coordinate(d1left)
      to[/tikz/circuitikz/bipoles/length=1cm, zD*, l_=$D_{1}$] (d1left -| capright)
      coordinate(d1right)
      to[short, -*] (d1right |- capright)
      % diode2 feedback
      (d1right) to[short, *-] ++(0,2)
      coordinate(d2right)
      to[/tikz/circuitikz/bipoles/length=1cm, zD*, l^=$D_{2}$] (d2right -| capleft)
      to[short, -*] (d1left);
\end{circuitikz}
\caption{Inverting soft clipping integrator}
\label{fig:invertingint}
\end{figure}

which follows the nonlinear ODE (assuming diodes are modelled with the forward current approximation)

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
V_{out}' &= -\frac{1}{RC} \space V_{in} - \frac{I_{s}}{C} \space \sinh \frac{V_{out}}{\eta \space V_{t}}    
\end{split}
\end{align}

where $I_s$ is the diode reverse saturation current, $\eta$ is the diode emission coefficient and $V_{t}$ is the diode thermal voltage.\newline

The above ODE can be solved using a numerical trapezoidal ODE solver. Inserting silicon diode parameters for the diode clipping circuit part of the equation results in a solution which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:integrator}. \newline

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \includegraphics[page=1, scale=0.58]{inverting_clipping_integrator2.pdf}
  \caption{Numerical solution to inverting soft clipping integrator ODE model}
  \label{fig:integrator}
\end{figure}

Implementing the soft clipping integrator in the filter results in the following final nonlinear ODE model 

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
x_{1}'(t) &= \alpha \space (input(t) - \zeta \space x_{1}(t) - x_{2}(t)) - a \space \sinh \frac{x_{1}(t)}{b} \\
x_{2}'(t) &= \alpha \space x_{1}(t) \\
\end{split}
\end{align}

It should be noted that the above model is idealized and differs from the practical implementation. The integrators on the board are both inverting ($\alpha < 0$) which should be taken into account when analysing the circuit operation. \newline

\subsection{Boosting resonance}

In state variable filters the damping factor control $\zeta$ is reversed: Lower factors result in more feedback, down to self-oscillation at damping factor 0 (with diode clipping limited integration), meaning damping factor can also be negative to drive the resonance oscillation further.\newline

This can be exploited in a practical circuit, where absolute zero damping factor is hard to realise with resistive voltage dividers (such as potentiometers and board traces with non-zero stray resistances). The R9 and R10 voltage divider fed in the opposite phase of the VR1 and R11 voltage divider input of the first integrator stage operational amplifier summer IC3G1 realises through zero modulation of the damping factor $\zeta$.

\section{Build instructions} \label{buildinstructions}

Notice that the through-hole PCB consists of panelized boards, one for front panel connectors and one for the power connector, integrators and input/output buffering. The boards are connected together with two 10-pin headers and a 11mm M3 PCB standoff.\newline

It is important to mount the 9mm potentiometers, Thonkiconn jack sockets and the M3 board standoff first \emph{without soldering} to the control PCB or the top side of the SMD version board and only after that attach them to the front panel with appropriate nuts. \newline


The building process should follow the following order

\begin{itemize}
\item Populate and solder resistors
\item Populate and solder signal diodes (only on bottom side for SMD board)
\item Populate and solder signal capacitors (only on bottom side for SMD board)
\item Populate and solder integrated circuits
\item Populate and solder ferrite beads (top side for SMD board)
\item Populate and solder power diodes (top side for SMD board)
\item Populate and solder electrolytic power filtering and decoupling signal capacitors (top side for SMD board)
\item For through-hole board, break the panelized boards in half and trim off mousebites
\item Solder power connector (make sure the pins match from schematics and board layout)
\item For through-hole board, solder the 10-pin headers
\item For through-hole board, mount 11mm M3 PCB standoff with a M3 screw on the upper control board
\item Mount the snap-in 9mm Alpha potentiometers VR4 and VR1 \emph{without soldering}
\item Mount the snap-in 9mm Alpha trimmers VR3, VR5 and VR2 \emph{without soldering}
\item Mount Thonkiconn jack sockets U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6 \emph{without soldering}
\item Mount the front panel
\item Fingertighten socket and potentiometer nuts to the panel
\item Solder in through-hole sockets and potentiometers
\item Tighten nuts fully with a tool
\item Mount potentiometer caps for VR4 and VR1
\item Finally for the through-hole board, connect the boards with the 10-pin headers and M3 screw for the PCB standoff
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SSM2164 issues}
The original Analog Devices SSM2164 has a fault which will burn the chip if the negative power supply rail becomes unconnected while the device is powered. This fault has been corrected in modern clones from SSI and Alpha but remains in Coolaudio V2164.\newline

\cite{johnson} has researched the failure (with Oscar Salas) and proposed a fix with a BAT85 diode. This is implemented starting from version 1.7 of the board.\newline

Please note that if you are using a SSI or Alpha clone (SSI2164 and AS2164 respectively) of SSM2164, the BAT85 diode can be safely left unpopulated.

\subsection{Capacitors}
Capacitors C29 and C30 are used for compensating parasitic effects of the PCB and component leads and should be left unpopulated and populated only if needed. The parasitic effects manifest themselves as increased resonance at higher cutoff frequencies.

\subsection{Power connector and headers}
Please note that version 1.5 of the boards had their power connector and header component footprint graphics mirrored by mistake. For the header pinouts this makes no difference but confusion could arise for the power connector. In any case, if a shrouded power connector is used, it should be mounted on the bottom side of the main board with the cutout slot facing away from the board.\newline

Follow and match the board and schematic graphics to the Eurorack power connector standard to make sure the pins deliver proper voltages to the board. The board is diode protected against reverse voltage.
